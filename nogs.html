<p><b>[Duplicate Pokemon without trading!!]</b> By
ELZEE19657@aol.com 9/24/99 </p>

<p>Okay but watch out this will erase one of your pokemon in your
6.Have the<br>
pokemon<br>
you want to duplicate in your top 6 then put one of your pokemon
in the PC<br>
then you<br>
should have 5 pokemon then catch a missingno, then go to the
Unknown Dungeon<br>
then get into a wild Chansey.Then wait until chansey does
minimize then go to<br>
&quot;pokemon&quot; then take a look at the stats of the pokemon
that you want to<br>
duplicate.<br>
Then when you go back to the screen you will see the pokemon you
wanted to<br>
duplicate but the name will still be &quot;chansey&quot; then
catch it it will erase<br>
one pokemon.<br>
then release the missingno.<br>
<br>
P.S.I'm not responsible for anything that happens.(not that any
thing will) </p>

on both versions<br>
<br>
1st:make sure to have a pokemon that can fly and one to surf<br>
2nd:talk to the man(in the top left edge of town) in Viridian
city,<br>
answer &quot;no&quot; to his question.<br>
3rd:when he's finished talking press &quot;start&quot; go to
&quot;items&quot; put any item<br>
you want 199 of in the 6th spot.<br>
4th:fly to cinnabaur island<br>
5th:go dirrectly to the east shore and use surf<br>
6th:go up and down dirrectly on the cost, you'll eventually fight
a<br>
missingno or another unnumbered pokemon<br>
7th:RUN from the first one you see, check your 6th item, there
should<br>
be a strange symbol and a 9 by it<br>
8th:congrats.! you just got alot of items! i.e. hp up, pp up,<br>
masterball, whatever you want (excluding special items like
bicycle) </p>

Now, Congratulation Player 1, you have 3 original Pokemon<br>

If this code is working, please post this in your code section so
everyone<br>
can do it.<br>
Thank you. </p>

<p><b>Report</b> </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Atif Ilyas</b></font>&gt;This is
about your code to get all pokemon from Prof. Oak. Have player 1
start out with a bulbasaur, then do the usual except have player
1 end up with 1 bulbasaur, 2 squirtles, and 2 charmanders by
repeating the process. then player 2 should start the game over
with a bulbasaur, go catch 2 pokemon, then go to the nearest
pokemon center and trade with player 1. this is what i know. </p>

<p><b>[Pokémon Duplication]</b> By PokemonMax 11/5/98<br>
Work on both American Versions. </p>

<p>Here is a trick to duplicate your pokemon. This works on the
American<br>
versions. I will try to explain it as good as I can. For this
trick to work,<br>
you need both games and two gameboys. Here is what you do:<br>
<br>
1. Put the pokémon you want duplicated into one of the games.
Either red<br>
or blue.<br>
Let's use red for an example.<br>
2. Put a pokémon you don't mind losing in the other cartridge.
Which is<br>
blue.<br>
3. Go to the trade center and trade the pokémon you want
duplicated (red)<br>
with the one<br>
you want to erase (blue).<br>
4. After they are traded, leave the game (blue) on with the
pokémon you<br>
erased and<br>
turn the game (red) off with the pokémon you wanted duplicated,
before<br>
the &quot;Trade<br>
Completed&quot; sign appears, right after the
&quot;Waiting...&quot; sign disappears.<br>
<br>
If you did the steps right, the game (red) with the pokémon you
wanted<br>
duplicated should still be there and the one you erased on the
other game<br>
(blue) should be the same as the one you traded. I tried to
explain it as<br>
best as I could so don't get mad at me if you can't get it
working.<br>
<br>
**Note: This might mess up your game, but I had no trouble with
it. If<br>
anything happens to your game please do not put the blame on me. </p>

<p><b>Report</b> </p>

<p><b>Draco346@aol.com&gt;</b>When using the duplication code
with the game link and a freind do not turn the game off after
the waiting sign turn the game of while the waiting sign is there
or your saved file data will be destroyed this happened to me
twice<br>
<br>
<b>BlackForce&gt;</b>hey.. i just wanted to say.. that for one of
the codes for the english version..duplicating pokemon.. the code
works.. w/ one exception!! you cannot duplicate a pokemon that
has learned a HM skill.. if you try duping a pokemon w/ a HM
skill.. it will screw up your game.<br>

<p><b>[Missingno!]</b> By Mike 12/17/98 </p>

<p>Hello, my name is Mike and I have a code to catch Missingno!
Before you go<br>
insane about this, read this first: Doing this messes up the
Pokemon<br>
leagues site and it can sometimes make your picture look really
funny! But<br>
anyway, here's how to do it.<br>
<br>
FLY to Cinnabar Island. Go into the Pokemon Research Lab, (The
place where<br>
they ressurect Pokemon fossils,) and trade with one of the people
in there.<br>
Then go to rightmost part of the island, and start SURFing up and
down the<br>
coast line so that it looks like your Pokemon is on half land,
half water.<br>
Keep going up and down until you encounter a wild Pokemon. The
screen will<br>
freeze black for about 5 to 10 seconds. Then you will be fighting
a<br>
scrambled square shaped thingy, that is Missingno. Do not, repeat
do not<br>
send out your strongest Pokemon to catch it! You will most likely
make it<br>
faint in one hit because it's defense totally stinks. Send out
you weakest<br>
Pokemon and use a medium powerful attack. After catching him,
save the game<br>
and turn it off. Turn it back on and then you can use him! You
follow the<br>
directions exactly otherwise you won't catch him. </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Warning!</b></font> This code is
dangerous and it can delete your Pokemon Game </p>

<p><b>Reports</b> </p>

level 80 missingno, use rare candy on him once, then you will

<p><b>[Masterball Secret]</b> By Zabunny 11/2/98 </p>

<p>Throw any kind of Pokeball (Greatball, Ultraball, or
Pokeball),<br>
and after it is released from your hand, hold UP + B.<br>
The ball will act like a Masterball! I caught Articuno, Moltres,<br>
Zapdos, and Snolax with this handy trick. It works, but takes a
bit of<br>
practice to get right. The trick works on both versions. </p>

<p><b>Report</b> </p>

<p><b>Mike Rafferty&gt;</b>You should put this under the Pokeball
Secret Code that it works and Icaught MewTwo with it. But it
doesn't work all the time. I wasted 4 UltraBalls untill I caught
it. From Mike Rafferty<br>
<br>
<b>Charmander&gt;</b>I have tried this code (B+up) as well as
holding &quot;A&quot; to make the pokeballs act like masterballs
many times and it doesn't seem to give you any greater chance of
capturing a pokemon. If you really want to capture a pokemon buy
some ultraballs, as they work best (but are most expensive).<br>
<br>
<font color="#1479F0"><b>A</b></font><font color="#F01479"><b>k</b></font><font
color="#7AF014"><b>i</b></font>&gt;People say that it will work
with Down+B too. </p>

<p><b>[Safari Pokemon at SEAFOAM ISLANDS 2]</b> By TaYMaN64
10/8/98 </p>

<p>OK.This is for both versions:<br>
<br>
1. Go to Safari Zone and then recive 30 safari balls.<br>
2. Right when you enter the safari zone, leave.<br>
3. The guy should say leaving early. Say yes.<br>
4. Then after you leave safari zone go to the seafoam island. But
dont go on<br>
the land.<br>
5. Stay along the cost and just go up and down while still on
your water<br>
pokemon that you ride on.<br>
6. You should run into wild pokemon from safari zone.<br>
7. And the good thing is you can use your own pokemon and
Pokeballs( pokeball,<br>
greatball, ultraball) to caputre safari zone pokemon!!<br>
<br>
THATS IT... please post this in your codes section...Thanx :o) </p>

<p><b>[extension on the safari pokemon]</b> By HobbesX 12/05/98 </p>

<p>(This is kind of an extension on the safari pokemon at seafoam
islands<br>
trick.)<br>
<br>
Go anywhere with unique pokemon (pokemon tower, MewTwo cave,
victory road<br>
cave) and then leave. Fly to cinnabar island and surf up and down
on the<br>
coast where it looks like you are half on land and half on water.
After a<br>
few seconds the unique pokemon will start appearing. This isn't
real<br>
useful, but its fun! </p>
