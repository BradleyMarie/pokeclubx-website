[how you get hms and tms] By STUDIOARTE@aol.com 12/13/98 

this is how you get hms and tms
enter 01xx82cf
replace the xs with c5 for hm02 c6 for hm03 c7 for hm04 c8 for hm05 and c4
for hm01. to get tms you just have to raise the number by one number or
lettor. i only tried it on the red it'll probably work on both versions.

i hope i explained it well.

[Missingno the Ghost] By Fettrulz@aol.com 5/17/99 

this is a code i stumbled apon while fighting the elite 4 on a saved game. first, go in a gym(or elite4) and save. turn off the game and start it upagain and put in the game shark code 02b8d8cf. when you go into battle, it will say something along the line of (the person's name) sent out ghost. it will be a level 0 ghost and you can kill it with one hit! not only that, but no mater how many pokemon the enemy has left, you beat them!note: don't use it if you'r searching for pokemon because 9 out of 10 times you'll fight a missingno. and 1 out of 10 times you'll fight a ghost but can't capture it. 

Tester-it worked.

[offical MEW (almost)] By KiDKoRnx@aol.com 3/21/99 

I think this has got to be the easiest way to catch a MEW 

1. Make sure Gameshark is turned off.
2. Enter this code: 001559DO
3. Start the game up and get to the screen where you can move ASH around
4. Make sure you have a MASTER BALL
5. Turn Gameshark on, and you will fight a wild MEW
6. Use MASTER BALL (duh)
7. You got an offical MEW (almost).
NOTE: Some say that this code will mess up your game. It wont. I tried this
code on 6 of my friends games and their games work perfectly.

[every pokemon (wild and trainers') level 208] By zapdos36@hotmail.com 4/05/99 

Hi, my friend <Arbok100@hotmail.com> and I found a gameshark code that
makes every pokemon (wild and trainers') level 208, the code is 01d0f3cf 

Report 

Aki&gt;It worked battling wild pokemon.

[Get Mew] By Jay 12/08/98 

0115D8CF

First enter this code. Then go into a patch of tall grass and walk around until you get
into a fight with a Pokemon. It should appear glitched. Capture it. It should be a Mew.
Once you catch it, it should be normal, and *GLITCH FREE*. The PokeDex even
updates data! Have fun with this one.


*Mew Stats*

Found: Anywhere (Just put in the code)
Type: Psychic
Level Starts At: Depends on what the level is of other Pokemon in that area.
Powers Available: Pound, Transform(Lev.10), Mega Punch(Lev.20), Metronome(Lev.30), Psychic(Lev.40)
Additional Notes: Mew can also learn ANY ability from ANY TM or HM!

[Ash will not send out any Pokemon] By PhAnToM 4/19/99 

I'm the person who sent in the ALMOST PERFECT MEW code. I found a weird code while playing. This is for the Gameshark.
00FF5ADO
Ash will not send out any Pokemon. Make sure you have Pokeballs as the first item in the items slot. When you fight a wild pokemon, ASH will not send out a pokemon. He will not fight, and if you try to Pick another Pokemon, it will say that it is already out. Go to items, and It will go to the Pokeballs, and you will throw one. This code is very useless. I was just bored and was looking through the GS

[Get master balls] By Atp191@aol.com 10/20/98 

01011ED3
(Note: Make sure you dont have anything valuable in the items box because it will delete those items and overwrite them with master balls.) Be cautious while using the master ball code it is known to make the game very dull and unexciting because of the easiness of catching the pokemon. I would only use the master balls on the three legendary birds,Mewtwo

psam ordener&gt;I tried the Ash will not send out any Pokemon code and it works!
LSnelgr@aol.com&gt;the game shark code for ash not to send out ant pokemon work's just fine
kent Wolkins&gt;I tested two codes (the pass through walls code and ash will not send out any pokemon code) and they both worked 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Pass through walls] By CybrWolf1@aol.com 4/29/99 

I have tried this code and it DOES work.

Punch in the code 01A47CCF and buy the Item called Nickname?? (It's expensive, so you may want to use this code along with the infinite money code.). Then, go to a wall an get next to it while facing down. Select the Nickname?? and hit B when the Select Pokemon screen appears. A bunch of pokemon should be at the left side of the screen. If you're on the Right side ofthe wall, press left on the control pad (Vice versa if you're on the right side, of course). Then, press start and go to your pokemon list. Exit the menu and you should be standing on the wall! Go either left or right to get off the wall. NOTE: You were never meant to pass through certain walls in the game, therefore when you pass through the wall, thescreen will go blank. Don't worry, though, for as far as I know that won't mess up the saved game. However, I tried the code once and it did delete my game. All I did was turn the game off and then on again and I got the game back, so this code really won't do much damage. Nevertheless, Use it at     your own risk!
